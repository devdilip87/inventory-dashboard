Key risk factors include high Days Sales Inventory (DSI), overstock conditions, low forecasted demand relative to current inventory levels, and seasonal misalignment. Items with the highest risk scores include Office Chair (Wales), Running Shoes (Wales), Body Lotion (Texas), and Vitamin C (Greater London).
